## A classic Breakout game with updated physics and old fashioned aesthetics

- Use left and right arrow keys to move the Paddle left and right. Or use a mouse or trackpad.
- Use the paddle to direct the ball upward to destroy the bricks.
- Destroy a wall completely in order move on to the next level.
- Each level adds a new layer of bricks to the wall.
- Defeat 5 walls in order to win the game.

## About

- Game adds highscore tracking using a Rails backend.
- Game adds left and right collision detection for bricks in order to bring a ricocheting element to the game. This was absent from the original.
- Game adds new levels to the original game, instead of simple having two identical levels. Now the wall increases in size as you complete each of the 5 levels.
- HTML5 particles were implemented to add visual dynamics to the destruction of the bricks.
- Most sounds are synthesized using oscillators.
- Atari styled intro animation gives the game a title sequence.
